## About Me
My name is Mark and I am currently working as a Monetization Manager and Liveops Designer with Dorado Games on the *Conflict of Nations: World War 3* title. While my professional life has been rooted in game design and monetization, I have a deep love for all things tech and code. In my free time, I work on various projects and explore different languages and tech stacks.
